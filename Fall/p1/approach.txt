I decided to use the data structure to keep track of a user's previous words 
as simply another DLB Trie. This was solely based on the fact that I simply 
didn't have time to think about another data structure.

I realize after completing and submitting that using a priority queue of 
some sort, whether it be merged with a Trie or not, would probably help me
to specify even further what I wanted. However, I just don't have the time.

I used the ArrayList<String> to store predictions of the user to make my 
life easy, although it has O(n) resizing when necessary. However, since I 
maintain only 5 strings in the arraylist at a time, this practically keeps 
my runtime to that of O(1). I also use an ArrayList<String> to keep track 
of all the user words that were entered and read in. This allows me to write 
out to a file quickly and efficiently (with regards to programming). Again, 
I would have used a quicker data structure were I to have more time, but for 
the time being this is good enough.

I also used some of the IO libraries from Java, I don't know much about them 
so I'm just going to acknowledge that I used them and pretty much the extent 
of my knowledge on them is what Oracle posts on their websites.
