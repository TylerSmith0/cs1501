Does your program run without error?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

I don't believe I properly implemented the minimum average latency spanning tree method, I feel
that I have a bit of a naive implementation.

Additionally, I don't feel very confident in my vertex failure method either. I think graphs 
are just something that I need a little bit more work on, although it certainly has gotten 
easier with the help of this project!


Additional comments to the grader:

Please be nice to me :-)
