I decided to use another DLB trie for my "user_history.txt" file because of the simplicity that
it would provide. The dictionary had a very easy way to wrap your head around how the storage of 
the words was, as was the actual maintenance of the text file used to generate the values. By 
utilizing the same structure, I was able to model the user history off of the dictionary as well, 
writing to individual lines as words are forced to be remembered with number entries or the $ 
symbol. It also allows for my prediction generation to be the same code used for the dictionary
and user history, allowing me the same runtime for both sets of data.
